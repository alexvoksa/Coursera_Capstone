# Coursera_Capstone
## This project is about COVID-19 spread in Moscow, Russia.</br></br>
In the beginning of the project you can see similarities and differences between</br>
Moscow, Russia and NY State, USA.</br></br>
Then I've parsed geodata from open sources, and visualized them on map of Moscow.</br>
I decided to help people avoid dengerous venues in their districts, so I used </br>
Foursquare API to get information about most popular venues near places, where </br>
COVID-19 was detected by ambulance.</br></br>
Logicaly, lots of people could visit these venues at same time and get infected.</br>
I want to warn them.</br>
I performed kNN clustering to group areas with similar venues. </br>
Notice, that it is not the best clustering. It can be highly improved. </br> </br>
So, you can see it on maps in this <a href = 'https://github.com/alexvoksa/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/CourseraCapstone.ipynb'>Jupyter Notebook</a>.</br>
In the very bottom of this notebook you can see table with venues, that should be avoided at all.</br></br></br>
#### CourseraCapstone.ipynb is a correct notebook for entire project.
